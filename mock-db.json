      "description": "Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany.\n            Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party\n            to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are\n            four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty\n            victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party\n            wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some\n            media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game\n            progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points\n            if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The 1986\n            edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports\n            up to five players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well. The 2006\n            edition also supports up to five players and adds a shorter five-round variant and additional rules updates\n            by the original designer.&#10;&#10;\n        ",

The 1966 version of the 3M bookshelf edition\n            included rules for a 2-player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.&#10;&#10;Many\n            books and websites incorrectly list this as a 1962 publication as the 3M Company used previously copyrighted\n            artwork when they released the game in 1964. 3M actually received the idea for the game of &quot;Vacations&quot;\n            from Sid Sackson in May of 1963 and decided to take his idea and put it into artwork they had developed the\n            year before for a game called &quot;ACQUIRE.&quot; 3M's original game idea for a game called ACQUIRE\n            must not have been very good so they decided to take Sid's idea of Vacations and put it into their concept\n            of ACQUIRE. They released some limited test market games in 8 Midwestern U.S. cities in December of 1963\n            with a box that had a 1963 copyright. These games had Sid's original rules. When 3M released the mass market\n            games in 1964, they had developed some of Sid's original ideas and changed some rules and game play to match\n            their production desires. They released them with outer boxes that were copyrighted 1962 and inner boxes\n            with rules that were dated 1963.&#10;&#10;December 1963 - Test Market World Map Wood Tile Edition&#10;1964\n            - Dated 1962/63 wood tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs&#10;1965\n            - Dated 1962/63 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs (last\n            edition made with printed backs until 1999)&#10;1966 - Dated 1962/66 plastic tiles, chipboard with\n            plastic overlay &amp; non-wax coated stocks (Only edition with these stocks)&#10;1968 - Dated\n            1968/66 plastic tiles, clear plastic board with paper underlay (Both 1966 inner box games have a lot of\n            mixed parts)&#10;1971 - Dated 1968/71 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board&#10;1975 - 3M sells\n            rights for game of ACQUIRE to the Avalon Hill Company&#10;1976 - Dated 1976 plastic tiles, yellow hard\n            plastic board, redesigned money, no inner box (This edition was also produced in 1977, 79, 81, 82, &amp;\n            86)&#10;1989 - Dated 1976 Gray box edition with new box artwork same contents as regular 1976 editions\n            (This edition was also produced in 1992)&#10;1995 - Dated 1995 Large box cardboard edition with\n            chipboard board and tiles, Special Powers Variant Tiles inspired by German editions&#10;1997 - Avalon\n            Hill sells the rights to the game of ACQUIRE to Hasbro&#10;1999 - Dated 1999 Large box with large\n            plastic board and tiles, 3D company buildings, redesigned stocks &amp; money, large info cards&#10;2006\n            - Hasbro assigns rights for the game of ACQUIRE to their subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast&#10;2006 -\n            Lloyd's (private) Rules of ACQUIRE are made public, two major rule changes that help to bring the balance of\n            the game of ACQUIRE back to the intentions of Sid Sackson's original ideas.

      "description": "Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads. The game is set in the mythical\n            world of the elves. A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty\n            Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds. To accomplish the task they will use various forms of\n            transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:\n            Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and\n            a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city\n            space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each\n            city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).&#10;\n            &#10; The round proceeds in 2 stages. The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles\n            showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles\n            (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles\n            and hope to get one they need). These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to\n            use them most effectively. After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any\n            one of the roads that run between the elf cities. Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so\n            players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand. This frequently\n            causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or\n            shorter than you had first thought. Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by\n            playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.&#10;&#10;Each mode of\n            transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are\n            listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols. The number of terrain symbols\n            equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain. For example, a\n            Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on\n            card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it\n            would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow\n            in Forest). Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of\n            transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow\n            upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed). The small lake requires 1 raft card to\n            travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across. Players may keep one unused transport\n            counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.&#10;&#10;The second part of the\n            round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round. Each player\n            plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited. If\n            there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan'\n            across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.&#10;&#10;As a bit of 'take that' each\n            player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the\n            round. This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be\n            played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.&#10;&#10;Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all\n            20 cities he is the winner. If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each\n            player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city\n            tokens. The person with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;\n        ",
